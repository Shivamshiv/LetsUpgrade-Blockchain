Assignment 1:

Q 1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity i.e. distributed systems. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).

Q 2. What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
- Currency and Transaction Support
- Establishing history of ownership
- Making supply chains more efficient and transparent
- Voting
- Government Operations
- Paying for contributions to intellectual property
- Banking and Logistics Issues
- Cloud Storage
- Real Estate
- Charity
- Crowdfunding

Q 3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
- Decentralization
- Transparency
- Immutability
- Security
- Verifiable
- Tamper proof

Q 4. What all things does a Block Contain?
- Block number
- Record/Data
- Previous block signature
- Mining key

Q 5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?
The verifiability of blockchain can be achieved by the fingerprint of the block which is generated by the combination of data and the previous-block fingerprint, which is stored in the distributed systems.

E.g: Fingerprint(00000..) + Genesis Block = Fingerprint 1
     Fingerprint 1 + Block_Data_2 = Fingerprint 2
     Fingerprint 2 + Block_Data_3 = Fingerprint 3 and so on..
